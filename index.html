    <p>The World Wide Web is a collection of billions of web pages that can be accessed through the internet.  To access a web page a person will need a computer with a web browser and a connection to the internet. The computer's web browser will make a request through the internet to a server (which is just a computer that is specially configured to host web pages) by using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  The server will send the appropriate files to the user's computer, and then the web browser will interpret and display the web page.</p>
    <p>Web pages are created by using many different computer languages.  The most important is Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML).  HTML is used to define the structure and content of the web page.  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to define the style and format of the web page.  And JavaScript is used to define the behavior of the web page, which allows the user to interact with different components. These languages can be written in a basic text editor, although it does help to have specially designed text editor.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionTitleBox">HTML</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="sectionContentBox">
    <p>HTML is used to create the structure and content of a web page.  An HTML document is made up of various <span class="keyword">elements</span>, each of which serves a different purpose.  For example, there is an element if you wish to include an image in the web page.  There is another element if you wish to create a text header. Below is an example of the element used to create a paragraph of text content:</p>
    <div class="exampleOfAnElementBox">
      <div class="exampleOfAnElementContent"> &lt;p&gt;<em>text content for paragraph goes here</em>&lt;/p&gt;
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>Not all elements will have content, so rather than have a start and close tag they can be written with a single tag.  These are called <span class="keyword">void tags</span>.</p>
    <p>HTML elements can also either be considered an <span class="keyword">inline</span> element or a <span class="keyword">block</span> element.  Inline elements represent a specific section of content within an element, whereas a block element refers to an invisible box that surrounds a section of the page.</p>
    <p>HTML elements can also have <span class="keyword">attributes</span>, which contain additional information about the element.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionTitleBox">DOM</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="sectionContentBox">
    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) refers to the 'tree-like' structure that an HTML document will undertake.  This structure is formed because elements can be nested within elements.  The DOM helps the web browser read the web page, and it is critical for understanding how CSS is used.</p>

    <p>CSS is another language which has its own syntax and rules.  CSS is used to apply style and formatting to the web page.  CSS is particularly useful because it allows you efficiently 'cascade' a rule to many elements, thus saving you time so you are not writing redundant code.  For example, you could write a single rule to turn the color of all your paragraphs red.

    <p>HTML and CSS may overwhelm you at first because there is so much that they can do - there are near endless number of elements in HTML and properities in CSS. Rather than trying to learn them all, focus on understanding how the languages work and building an awareness for what they can do.  Then you can search various resources if you need to find instructions for doing something specific.  Here are some resources that I have found helpful:
